# zombie-SARS-CoV-2
A graph-based tunable epidemic simulation.
The simulation takes place in Paris and allows the user to tune both social and intrinsic parameters.
The program displays a real time visualization of population movements and the epidemic's key numbers.

The simulation also includes a "zombie mode" where some people have a user-defined probability to develop zombie-like symptoms. The zombies were designed to modelize "super infectors" and is entirely tunable to further study virus propagation in local areas.
